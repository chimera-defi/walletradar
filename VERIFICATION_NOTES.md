### ❌ Cards Likely Inactive/Defunct

1. **Mode Card** - ❌ **LIKELY DEFUNCT**: modeapp.com completely unreachable (timeout after 25+ seconds on multiple attempts). Note: mode.com is a DIFFERENT company (ThoughtSpot Mode - business intelligence tool, not crypto). The Mode Bitcoin card company appears inactive/defunct. **Recommendation: Strike through in comparison table.**

### ✅ Cards Verified Working (Updated January 7, 2026)

1. **Gemini Card** - ✅ **WORKING**: Website accessible, "Earn up to 4% crypto back on every purchase with no annual fee", issued by WebBank. Bitcoin, ETH, and 50+ crypto reward options available.

### ⚠️ Cards Needing Status Verification

1. **Hi Card** - Website shows 2021-2022 copyright, card product info minimal/unclear. Main site (hi.com) loads but card-specific features not prominent. High cashback claims (10%) unverified. Status uncertain ⚠️
2. **Uphold Card** - `/card` reachable via r.jina.ai but no card-specific details; `/debit-card` times out. Card product status uncertain ⚠️
3. **Bybit Card** - HTTP2 protocol errors on ALL tested URLs (including en, en-GB, en-US, nl regional variants). May be heavily geo-restricted or undergoing service changes ⚠️
4. **Swissborg Card** - Card-specific page (swissborg.com/card) returns 404 in headless Chromium. Swissborg fees page exists but is app-level, not card-specific. Product status unclear ⚠️

### Previous Verifications (December 2025)

1. **Crypto.com Visa Card** - Confirmed "up to 5% back" (higher tiers may vary)
2. **Nexo Card** - Confirmed "up to 2% crypto cashback", "No monthly/annual/inactivity card fees"
3. **Plutus Card** - Confirmed "3-9% in PLUS Rewards", "3% Back" base rate, "No fees. No Catch."
4. **Shakepay Card** - Confirmed "up to 1.5% cashback", "No annual fees. No credit checks either."

### ⚠️ Cards with Website Access Issues (404 Errors)

1. **Swissborg Card** - https://swissborg.com/card returns 404 (headless Chromium)
2. **Uphold Card** - https://uphold.com/card returns generic content via r.jina.ai; no card details
3. **CoinJar Card** - https://www.coinjar.com/card returns 404

**Action Required:** These cards need manual verification to confirm:
- If card products still exist
- Correct website URLs
- Current card status

### ✅ Cards Verified via Browser Automation

1. **Reap** - ✅ Verified December 2025 via Playwright (see detailed section below)
2. **EtherFi Cash** - ✅ Verified December 2025 via browser automation (see detailed section below)

### ⚠️ Cards Needing Deeper Verification

The following cards' websites exist but initial scraping didn't find specific rate information (may require JavaScript or deeper navigation):
- Coinbase Card
- Binance Card - "Up to 8%" (high rate, verify if requires BNB staking)
- Wirex Card - "Up to 8%" (high rate, verify if requires WXT staking)
- Gemini Credit Card
- BitPay Card (cashback mentioned but no percentage found)
- Fold Card (bitcoin rewards mentioned but no percentage found)
- CryptoSpend Card

**Note:** High cashback rates (8-10%) typically require significant token staking/holding. Verify actual base rates vs. maximum rates with staking requirements.

## Custody Verification (January 2026)

Custody classifications were verified via browser automation (Playwright) by searching for self-custody keywords on official websites.

### ✅ Self-Custody Cards Verified

| Card | Evidence | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Ready Card** | "100% self-custody", "stay in control with self-custody", "Pioneering self-custody since 2017" | ready.co/card |
| **EtherFi Cash** | "non-custodial, cashback credit card", "Non-custodial & secure", "Your crypto remains in your control" | ether.fi/cash |
| **Gnosis Pay** | "SELF-CUSTODIAL", "Self-Custody: Users maintain full control", "Take control of your money through your SAFE account" | gnosispay.com |
| **CryptoSpend** | "Optional self-custody for advanced users", "Transparent custody infrastructure" | cryptospend.com.au |

### 🏦 Exchange Custody Cards

Exchange-based cards where funds are held on the exchange platform:
- Coinbase Card, Gemini Card, Binance Card, KuCoin Card, OKX Card, CoinJar Card, Kraken Card, Crypto.com Visa, Bybit Card

### 📋 CeFi Custody Cards

Cards issued by centralized finance companies where the company holds funds:
- Hi Card, Wirex Card, Fold Card, Plutus Card, Revolut Crypto, Shakepay Card, Redotpay, Nexo Card, Swissborg Card, BitPay Card, Reap, Uphold Card

### ⚠️ Notes on 1inch Card

The 1inch Card is classified as self-custody based on marketing ("tied to your crypto wallet"), but it's a "prepaid Mastercard powered by Crypto Life (CL), developed in partnership with Baanx". For prepaid cards, funds typically leave user control when loaded. Classification kept as self-custody per marketing, but users should verify actual custody model.
