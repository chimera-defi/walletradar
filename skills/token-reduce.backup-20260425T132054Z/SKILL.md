description: |
  Reduce total token usage across AI coding tasks by keeping discovery, reading, and follow-up context minimal.
  Use when file location is uncertain, the repo is large, or the user asks to explore, review, gather context, or work across multiple files.
  Prefer QMD BM25 when available; otherwise fall back to scoped `rg`. Skip for small edits with an exact file path.
  For GitHub/browser-heavy tool tasks, prefer AXI companions (`gh-axi`, `chrome-devtools-axi`) when installed.

# Token Reduction Skill

## Description

Use targeted retrieval and short summaries for `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Triggers

- The user asks to review, explore, search for context, or find where something lives.
- The user asks to validate, check, verify, improve, fix, or update a skill, hook, script, or file.
- The user's request implies the skill is not being used correctly or needs to work better.
- You do not know the exact file path yet.
- The task spans several files or areas of the repo.
- Broad scans or full-file reads would likely waste context.
- When maintaining this skill itself, the same narrow-discovery rules apply.

## Skip

- The exact file path is already given and the task is a small local edit.
- A one-command operational check is enough.
- A direct targeted read is clearly cheaper than search.

## First Move

- If file location is unknown, start with one standalone discovery command:
  - `scripts/token-reduce-paths.sh topic words`
  - `scripts/token-reduce-snippet.sh topic words`
- If the exact symbol is already known and `token-savior` is installed, you may use:
  - `uv run python scripts/token-reduce-structural.py --project-root . find-symbol ExactSymbol`
  - `uv run python scripts/token-reduce-structural.py --project-root . change-impact ExactSymbol`
- Prefer `scripts/token-reduce-paths.sh` for the initial path-only kickoff.
- Prefer the structural helper only for exact symbol or dependency questions; do not use it as the default for vague repo discovery.
- Use `scripts/token-reduce-snippet.sh` only when the path list is not enough.
- Do not treat raw `qmd search` or raw `rg` as the first compliant move when the helper is available; those belong inside the helper workflow or as a narrow follow-up after helper output.
- Do not chain discovery commands with `||`, `&&`, `find`, `ls`, or extra fallback shell logic.
- Do not treat `rg --files .` as compliant discovery.
- Do not start with `find .`, `ls -R`, `grep -R`, or broad `Glob` patterns such as `**/*`.
- After two failed discovery attempts or once the candidate set exceeds 5 files, stop expanding and ask the user to narrow the scope.

## Heuristics

| Strategy | Measured Savings | When |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| Concise responses | 89% | Always |
| QMD BM25 search | 99% vs naive reads | Finding which files to read |
| Targeted reads | 33% | Large files |
| Parallel calls | 20% | Independent lookups |
| Caveman-style output profile (optional companion) | 20–65% output token reduction in upstream caveman benchmarks | When the user explicitly asks for extra brevity |
| AXI companion tools (optional) | Fewer turns in upstream AXI studies for GitHub/browser tasks | When work is primarily GitHub or browser automation |
| Adaptive tier router | Auto-promotes/demotes helper tier from behavior and query intent | Default first move when path is unknown (`token-reduce-adaptive`) |
| Context Mode companion (optional) | Up to ~98% reduction in output-heavy fixture comparisons | When tasks are dominated by huge tool payloads (logs, test output, API dumps) |
| code-review-graph companion (optional) | 6x–10x token wins on larger-repo token-efficiency samples; can lose on tiny single-file diffs | Large monorepo review, dependency blast-radius, architecture impact tasks |

## Process

1. Check QMD once per session:
   ```bash
   command -v qmd >/dev/null 2>&1 && qmd collection list 2>/dev/null | head -1
   ```
   If unavailable, use scoped `rg`.
2. If you know the file or keyword, use a scoped grep first, then read only the needed lines.
3. If you need an auto-routed kickoff, use `scripts/token-reduce-adaptive.sh topic words`.
4. If you need a low-token path-only kickoff, use `scripts/token-reduce-paths.sh topic words`.
5. If you need one ranked excerpt after the kickoff, use `scripts/token-reduce-snippet.sh topic words`.
6. If a file is large, read only the relevant section.
7. If the search space stays broad, stop expanding and ask the user to narrow it.
8. For GitHub/browser-heavy execution, prefer `gh-axi` or `chrome-devtools-axi` over higher-overhead interfaces when available.
9. When routing behavior should be formally constrained, apply a profile (`minimal-load`, `balanced`, `max-savings`) via `token-reduce-manage.sh settings profile apply <name>`.

## Output Brevity Profile (Companion)

When the user asks for tighter responses, apply a caveman-inspired **lite** profile:

- remove pleasantries, hedging, and filler
- keep technical terms exact
- keep code blocks, commands, and error text exact
- prefer short, direct statements over narrative framing

Do not force this style when clarity or safety would degrade. This is optional, not the default for every user.

## Success Criteria

- Discovery starts with QMD BM25 or scoped `rg`, not recursive shell scans.
- `scripts/token-reduce-search.sh` uses repo-scoped QMD first, then scoped `rg`.
- `rg --files .` and similar broad inventory commands are treated as violations.
- Reads stay targeted.
- Final summaries cite only the minimum files needed.
- Repo-level instructions and hooks point at the same first-move workflow.

## QMD

```bash
command -v qmd >/dev/null 2>&1 || bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd

qmd collection add /path/to/repo --name my-repo
# default token-reduce scope mirrors docs+code extensions:
# qmd collection add /path/to/repo --name my-repo --mask '**/*.{md,txt,rst,py,sh,bash,zsh,js,jsx,ts,tsx,mjs,cjs,json,yml,yaml,toml,ini,cfg,go,rs,java,rb,php}'

qmd search "topic" -n 5 --files
qmd search "topic" -n 5
qmd get filename.md -l 50 --from 100
```

Skip `qmd embed`, `qmd vsearch`, and `qmd query` for this workflow.

## Anti-Patterns

- Restating requests
- Narrating tool usage
- Starting exploration with `find .`, `ls -R`, `grep -R`, or broad `Glob` patterns
- Reading entire large files
- Re-reading the same file in one session unless it changed
- Per-file commentary instead of a single summary
