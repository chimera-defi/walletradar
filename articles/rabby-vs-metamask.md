## The Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### 🚀 Best Developer Workflow

**Most developers should use BOTH:**

```bash
Daily Development:
├── Primary: Rabby Wallet (security, stability, features)
├── Testing: MetaMask (compatibility, user acceptance)
└── Backup: Rainbow or Trust (additional coverage)
```

**Practical Workflow:**

1. **Development Phase:** Use Rabby exclusively
   - Transaction simulation catches errors early
   - Scam detection prevents costly mistakes
   - Stable releases = predictable environment

2. **Testing Phase:** Add MetaMask testing
   - Test all user flows in MetaMask
   - Verify wallet detection works
   - Check for MetaMask-specific bugs

3. **Pre-Launch Phase:** Test with 3+ wallets
   - Rabby (developer-focused users)
   - MetaMask (mainstream users)
   - Rainbow/Trust (mobile-first users)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both Rabby and MetaMask at the same time?

Yes! Both are browser extensions and can coexist. However, you'll need to select which wallet to use for each dApp connection. Best practice: Set Rabby as default for development, manually select MetaMask for compatibility testing.

### Will Rabby replace MetaMask?

Unlikely in the near term. MetaMask has 90%+ market share and massive ecosystem integration. Rabby is better for developers but MetaMask remains essential for compatibility testing. Use both.

### Is Rabby compatible with MetaMask seed phrases?

Yes, Rabby can import MetaMask seed phrases (and vice versa). Both use standard BIP-39 mnemonics and BIP-44 derivation paths. You can access the same accounts in both wallets.

### Does Rabby work with Ledger and Trezor?

Yes, Rabby supports both Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. Connect via USB or Bluetooth (depending on device) and sign transactions with your hardware wallet while using Rabby's interface.

### Why does MetaMask score lower (73 vs 92)?

MetaMask scores lower due to: (1) High release churn (8 releases/month) causing frequent breaking changes, (2) No transaction simulation, (3) Weaker scam detection. However, it remains necessary for compatibility testing due to market dominance.

### Which wallet do most developers use?

MetaMask still dominates with 60-70% developer adoption. However, Rabby is rapidly growing among experienced developers who prioritize security and stability. Many developers use both: Rabby for daily work, MetaMask for testing.

### Can I develop dApps that work with both?

Yes! Both implement the EIP-1193 Ethereum Provider API standard. Code that works with MetaMask generally works with Rabby. Always test with both wallets before launch.

### Is transaction simulation really that important?

Yes, extremely important. Transaction simulation prevents costly mistakes by showing you the exact outcome BEFORE you sign. In DeFi development, a single mistake can cost thousands of dollars. Rabby's simulation has saved developers from numerous scams and errors.

### How often does Rabby break dApp compatibility?

Rarely. Rabby has ~6 releases per month with fewer breaking changes than MetaMask's ~8 releases per month. Most Rabby updates are additive features or bug fixes, not breaking API changes.

### Should beginners use Rabby or MetaMask?

Beginners should start with MetaMask due to better documentation and larger community support. Once comfortable with Web3 concepts, switch to Rabby for better security and developer experience. Keep MetaMask installed for compatibility testing.
