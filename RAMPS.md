### Legend

**Scoring & Recommendation:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Score** | 0-100 weighted score ([methodology](./RAMPS_DETAILS.md#scoring-methodology)) |
| **Rec** | 🟢 Recommended (75+) | 🟡 Situational (50-74) | 🔴 Avoid (<50) |

**Ramp Details:**
| Column | Values |
|--------|--------|
| **Type** | Both (On-Ramp + Off-Ramp), On-Ramp Only, Off-Ramp Only |
| **On-Ramp** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Off-Ramp** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Status** | ✅ Active | ⚠️ Verify | 🔄 Launching soon |
| **Coverage** | Number of countries supported (~160+ = most coverage; verify on official sites) |
| **Fee Model** | Processing fee structure (Low/Medium/High, Variable, Usage Based) |
| **Min Fee** | Minimum transaction fee (~ indicates approximate; verify on official sites) |
| **Dev UX** | Developer experience rating (Excellent/Great/Good/Advanced) |

**Fee Structure Notes:**
- **Processing Fee:** Charged by the ramp provider (typically 1% - 4.5%)
- **Network Fee:** Gas costs (paid by user)
- **Spread:** Difference between quoted price and market spot price (often hidden, 1% - 3%)
- "Zero Fee" promotions often hide costs in the **Spread**. Always check final "Amount Received" vs. Spot Price.

**Developer Integration:**
- **Widget (No-Code/Low-Code):** Embed iframe or React component (Transak, MoonPay, Ramp, Banxa)
- **API (Custom UI):** Build your own UI, provider handles logic (Sardine, Stripe, MoonPay Enterprise, Transak Enterprise)

**KYC & Compliance:**
- All providers act as **Merchant of Record (MoR)** - handle chargebacks, fraud, and KYC
- **Tiered KYC:** Low tier (<$150) = Name + Address + DOB; High tier (>$150) = ID Scan + Selfie
- **Sardine** and **Stripe** noted for better fraud detection (reduces false declines)

**Supported Chains:**
- **Transak & MoonPay:** Widest range of long-tail assets and chains (L1s, L2s, some L3s)
- **Coinbase Pay:** Strong Coinbase ecosystem integration (Base, Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin)
- **Ramp:** Strong focus on Ethereum L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Base)
- **Stripe:** Conservative asset list (mostly majors: BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC)
- **Modern Treasury:** Enterprise payment infrastructure with crypto capabilities
- **BitPay:** Bitcoin-focused with some altcoin support
- **Guardarian, Utorg, CoinGate:** Multi-chain support with varying coverage
