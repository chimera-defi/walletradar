## 💰 Fee Structure Analysis

Fees are the biggest friction point for users. They typically consist of three parts:
1.  **Processing Fee:** charged by the ramp (e.g., 1% - 3.5%).
2.  **Network Fee:** Gas costs (user pays).
3.  **Spread:** The difference between the quoted price and market spot price (often hidden, 1% - 3%).

| Provider | Est. Processing Fee | Est. Spread | Min. Fee | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Ramp** | ~0.99% - 2.9% | Low (~1%) | ~€2.49 | Competitive for bank transfers. Verify on ramp.network |
| **Transak** | ~3.5% (Cards) | Medium (~2%) | ~$5.00 | Fee varies heavily by payment method. Verify on transak.com |
| **MoonPay** | ~4.5% (Cards) | High (~2-3%) | ~$3.99 | Often the most expensive, but highest conversion. Verify on moonpay.com |
| **Stripe** | Custom | Custom | Custom | Usage-based pricing for businesses. Verify on stripe.com |

> **Agent Insight:** "Zero Fee" promotions often hide costs in the **Spread**. Always check the final "Amount Received" vs. Spot Price.

## 🛠️ Developer Experience (DX)

### 1. Integration Methods
*   **Widget (No-Code/Low-Code):** The easiest way. You embed an iframe or use a React component.
    *   *Supported by:* Transak, MoonPay, Ramp, Banxa.
*   **API (Custom UI):** You build the UI, they handle the logic. Requires more compliance work (PCI-DSS often handled by them, but UI is on you).
    *   *Supported by:* Sardine, Stripe, MoonPay (Enterprise), Transak (Enterprise).

### 2. KYC & Compliance
*   **Merchant of Record (MoR):** All listed providers act as the MoR. They handle chargebacks, fraud, and KYC.
*   **Tiered KYC:**
    *   **Low Tier (<$150):** Often just Name + Address + DOB (Simplified).
    *   **High Tier (>$150):** ID Scan + Selfie required.
*   **Friction:** **Sardine** and **Stripe** are noted for better fraud detection that reduces false declines, a major issue with crypto purchases.

### 3. Supported Chains
*   **Transak & MoonPay:** Support the widest range of long-tail assets and chains (L1s, L2s, some L3s).
*   **Coinbase Pay:** Strong Coinbase ecosystem integration (Base, Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and Coinbase-supported chains).
*   **Ramp:** Strong focus on Ethereum L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Base).
*   **Stripe:** More conservative asset list (mostly majors: BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC).
*   **Modern Treasury:** Enterprise payment infrastructure with crypto capabilities, primarily US-focused.
*   **BitPay:** Bitcoin-focused with some altcoin support (BCH, ETH, LTC, XRP, DOGE).
*   **Guardarian, Utorg, CoinGate:** Multi-chain support with varying coverage of major chains.

## 🟢 Recommendation Guide

### "I need..."

*   **...to support the most countries & tokens:**
    *   👉 **Transak** or **MoonPay**. They cover 160+ countries and thousands of tokens.

*   **...the lowest fees for my users:**
    *   👉 **Ramp Network** (especially for bank transfers/SEPA).

*   **...higher limits & instant settlement in the US:**
    *   👉 **Sardine**. Their "Instant ACH" is a game changer for high-value NFT mints or DeFi deposits.

*   **...my users to feel safe:**
    *   👉 **Stripe**. Users recognize the brand and UI.

*   **...to support local payment methods (e.g., POLi in Australia, iDEAL in Netherlands):**
    *   👉 **Banxa**. They specialize in local payment rails.

---

## ⚠️ Implementation Checklist
1.  **Webhooks:** Set up webhooks to listen for `ORDER_COMPLETED` or `ORDER_FAILED` events to update your UI.
2.  **Environment:** Always test in `STAGING` / `SANDBOX` mode first. Real money testing is painful.
3.  **Geo-Blocking:** Ensure your UI handles unsupported regions (e.g., New York, Texas, Crimea, etc.) gracefully if the widget doesn't auto-detect.

## Scoring Methodology

The scoring system evaluates ramps across multiple dimensions:

1. **Coverage (25 points):** Number of countries and payment methods supported
2. **Fee Structure (20 points):** Processing fees, spreads, and minimum fees
3. **Developer Experience (20 points):** SDK quality, documentation, integration ease
4. **Supported Chains/Assets (15 points):** Number of chains and tokens supported
5. **KYC/Compliance (10 points):** Fraud detection, false decline rates, KYC friction
6. **Reliability (10 points):** Uptime, transaction success rates, settlement speed

**Scoring Adjustments:**
- **+5 pts** Excellent developer documentation and SDKs
- **+3 pts** Instant settlement options (e.g., Sardine Instant ACH)
- **-5 pts** High fees relative to competitors
- **-3 pts** Limited geographic coverage

**Scoring Notes:**
- Scores are estimates based on available documentation and industry knowledge
- Original 7 providers (Transak, MoonPay, Ramp, Sardine, Stripe, Banxa, Mercuryo) scored based on verified PR 128 research
- Additional providers scored using same methodology but may need verification
- Scores should be considered approximate until verified with official provider documentation
